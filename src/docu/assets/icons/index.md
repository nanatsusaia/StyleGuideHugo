## Icons

An icon font is a web font that represents icons instead of letters and is primarily used as functional pictograms. They are an alternative to pure image files or CSS sprites. Since icon fonts are usually created as vector fonts, they can be graphically scaled and have a smaller file size than pixel icons.
