## Root Size

The sizes of all texts, components and layouts are based on the root font size. This is one of
the most important basic parameters in the entire style guide. The default root font size corresponds
to the browser font size, which is 16px by default and can be changed by the user in the browser.

On mobile devices, we will scale the standard font size up to 18px so that all texts, components
and layouts are easier to use for touch devices.

The individual themes can change this font size.
